# greatest_common_divisor_sequential_logic_vhdl
Aim of this lab is to understand how to implement registers on the Basys 3 FPGA board and design a digital circuit that calculates greatest common divisor of 2, 8 bit numbers as it requires an iterative process it is reasonable to use registers instead of combinational circuit design. Different algorithms can be used to calculate GCD of two numbers in the project Euclidean algorithm is used.
